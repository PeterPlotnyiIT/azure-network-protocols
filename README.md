<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Provision Azure Virtual Machines
- Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) Rules
- Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark
- Analyze Captured Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

First, we set up two virtual machines in Azure, one running Windows 10 and the other running Ubuntu Server 20.04. We then configured Network Security Groups to control the traffic flow.

<p>
Using Wireshark, we captured various types of network traffic, such as SSH, RDP, DNS queries, HTTP/S, and ICMP packets. This allowed us to analyze and understand the traffic patterns and security implications.
